# Essence

> Essence was a hope for success that unfortunately didn't quite pan out.

When you're working on a project, try your best to **differentiate between noise and signals from your ego**.  

One of the main reasons I abandoned *Essence* was this noise that told me my code wasn't clean, that other people were more organized, and that I should start following standards.  
I sought too much approval from other programmers and allowed myself to forget the most important thing in software development:

> **What matters isn't exactly how you do it. But what the end user experience gives you.**

My advice is that you shouldn't be alarmed by these new coding standards when you look at your project and see that you don't have any of them.  

Of course, it's important to use standards here and there. But try to encourage your own instincts.  
Design your project according to **your** style.

*Essence* is a project of an executor who failed. But in practice, I learned a lot from this failure.  

I'm releasing this and another version that have a completely messy and crazy architecture (*lol*) â€” but I believe it's still possible to learn something from it.
